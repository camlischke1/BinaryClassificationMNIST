# BinaryClassificationMNIST
This project classifies the handwritten digit images of the mnist dataset using a logistic regression single neuron neural network. Open and run the jupyter notebook to get a tutorial on how to build this logistic regression model by scratch.


Logistic regression using a neural network implementation framework (93% undergrad, 83% grad)
Prof. Andrew Ng's Coursera videos, assigned in Module 1, explain how logistic regression can be implemented as a single neuron that receives images as input and predicts their 
classification into one of two classes (cats vs. non-cats in his videos). He explains in detail how the process can be separated into a forward pass, calculation of a loss 
function, and numerical optimization using gradient descent in the back propagation step.

Your job for this part of the project is to implement the "logistic regression with a neural network mindset" approach described by Professor Ng. For this you, will use a Jupyter 
notebook provided as part of his Coursera course.
